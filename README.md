# Automatic-Control-Connection-via-SMS
 We intend to build a smart home device that will allow us to control all kinds of home appliances by sending SMS. Our circuit is made using sim 900 module and Arduino uno and its program is written in c and c++ language and written in Arduino IDE software environment.

Here, we are trying to control one of the home appliances by sending SMS to the peripheral device by default. Our device is with Arduino and SIM900 modules.
